# @summary This class manages compact service
#
# This class install Compact as service to continuously compacts blocks in an object store bucket.
#
# @param ensure
#  State ensured from compact service.
# @param user
#  User running thanos.
# @param group
#  Group under which thanos is running.
# @param bin_path
#  Path where binary is located.
# @param log_level
#  Only log messages with the given severity or above. One of: [debug, info, warn, error, fatal]
# @param log_format
#  Output format of log messages. One of: [logfmt, json]
# @param tracing_config_file
#  Path to YAML file with tracing configuration. See format details: https://thanos.io/tracing.md/#configuration
# @param http_address
#  Listen host:port for HTTP endpoints.
# @param http_grace_period
#  Time to wait after an interrupt received for HTTP Server.
# @param data_dir
#  Data directory in which to cache blocks and process compactions.
# @param objstore_config_file
#  Path to YAML file that contains object store configuration. See format details: https://thanos.io/storage.md/#configuration
# @param consistency_delay
#  Minimum age of fresh (non-compacted) blocks before they are being processed.
#    Malformed blocks older than the maximum of consistency-delay and 30m0s will be removed.
# @param retention_resolution_raw
#  How long to retain raw samples in bucket. 0d - disables this retention
# @param retention_resolution_5m
#  How long to retain samples of resolution 1 (5 minutes) in bucket. 0d - disables this retention
# @param retention_resolution_1h
#  How long to retain samples of resolution 2 (1 hour) in bucket. 0d - disables this retention
# @param wait
#  Do not exit after all compactions have been processed and wait for new work.
# @param downsampling_disable
#  Disables downsampling. This is not recommended as querying long time ranges without non-downsampled data is
#    not efficient and useful e.g it is not possible to render all samples for a human eye anyway
# @param block_sync_concurrency
#  Number of goroutines to use when syncing block metadata from object storage.
# @param compact_concurrency
#  Number of goroutines to use when compacting groups.
# @param selector_relabel_config_file
#  Path to YAML file that contains relabeling configuration that allows selecting blocks.
#    It follows native Prometheus relabel-config syntax.
#    See format details: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config
# @param extra_params
#  Parameters passed to the binary, ressently released in latest version of Thanos.
# @example
#   include thanos::compact
